## What this project is
The project is mainly focused on using Python and a few couple of Python Libraries to do some thorough intuitive analysis to answer several statistical questions based on the foundational concept of statistics.

Within each different Ipython Notebooks analyses are done to answer different questions. It's excited to check the Notebooks and see how python could be useful for fundamental statistical analysis.
